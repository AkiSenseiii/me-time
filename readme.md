# Me-Time

I created a clone website from scratch that incorporates the Pomodoro app, the Todo app, a music player, and the YouTube Search API. It is designed for people who want to study while also relaxing. Each application has its own set of applications. See the markdown below for more information.

Here's the link of the live site: 

## The following languages I used:

# Todo App

<p>It allows you to increase your productivity by preventing you from forgetting things, assisting you in prioritizing tasks, managing tasks effectively, using time wisely, and improving your time management and workflow.</p>

### What's the benefits of Todo App list?

The to-do app will help you stay organized, which is one of the most important reasons to use it. It will be easier to manage if you make a list of all your tasks. It helps you stay focused after you've completed all of your tasks. while creating mental space for other creative tasks or ideas.

When you have completed the task, just simply click the checkbox button, it will give you a sense of accomplishment and motivate you to move on to the next task.

# Pomodoro App

Pomodoro is a study technique that involves setting a timer for your sessions and breaks. You can do deep work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break at the end of each session. It is used to help students manage their time so that they can study throughout the day.

It's worth noting that the Pomodoro technique may not work for everyone. Some people may find it too rigid or restrictive, while others may need longer or shorter work and break intervals. Ultimately, the key to success with any study technique is finding what works best for you and your learning style.

# Music Player

I have created a music player that includes pomodoro and to-do apps to enhance the user's studying or work experience. The music player is designed to provide a relaxing atmosphere, enabling the user to focus better while studying or working on their tasks. Additionally, the player has a variety of music options that can help to set the user's mood according to their preference, making the experience more personalized. By using this music player, the user can expect to feel calmer, more motivated, and focused, which can lead to increased productivity and better overall results.


# Youtube Search API

I developed a YouTube search API to allow users to customize music while browsing the website, eliminating the need for them to go to YouTube, and if they aren't satisfied with the music player, they can simply dive into the YouTube side bar. It will also make browsing YouTube easier for the user, as they will simply click the sidebar button to search for what they are looking for.
